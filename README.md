## Technical Details
  Character Chords is a full-stack Ruby on Rails app that uses a variety of technologies to provide a seamless and engaging music exploration experience. Here are some of the key technologies we use:

  - **`Ruby:`** Character Chords is built with Ruby, a powerful and dynamic programming language that is well-suited to web development.
  - **`HTML/CSS:`** We use HTML and CSS to create the app's user interface and styling, respectively.
  - **`Tailwind CSS:`** Character Chords leverages Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to create a streamlined and responsive design.
  - **`CircleCI:`** We use CircleCI for our continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, which automates the testing and deployment of new code changes.
  - **`Ruby on Rails CI:`** Character Chords is also tested using Ruby on Rails CI, a GitHub Action that runs tests for Ruby on Rails applications.
  - **`Spotify OAuth:`** We use Spotify OAuth to enable users to log in to the app securely and access their Spotify accounts.
  - **`Amazon S3:`** Character Chords utilizes Amazon S3 for cloud storage, which allows us to securely store and manage user-generated content like playlists and user data.
  - **`External APIs:`** Character Chords consumes external APIs from `Spotify` and `OpenAI` to provide personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and personality traits.

  - ### Learning Goals
    - Create a web application that solves a real world problem and utilizes Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
    - Implement authentication via OAuth and consume at least two other APIs.
    - Develop a Rails "back end" API that acts as the interface layer to the database, handles API consumption, and uses Serializers.
    - Gain professional development benefits such as experience working on a larger team, understanding the impact of changes on a system, and familiarity with SOA/multi-app systems.
